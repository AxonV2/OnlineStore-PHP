# Online Tech Store - PHP

Made mostly using PHP and SQL queries, this is my first attempt at an online tech store. 

I'm more back-end orientated, and I'm still learning so it's not much front-end-wise YET.

To configure the database connection, please go to the includes folder and look for basededados.php

Website admin login:
**Email** – 123@gmail.com || **Password** – 123

## List of features:

    Login, registry, and password recovery system
    Admin area where the admin can add, remove and edit items. 
    User bound shopping cart.
    Storewide search bar.
    Ability to comment and rate products
